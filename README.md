## 1. Vertical Chosen

**Election Process Education**

CivicIQ targets the critical gap between citizens and their democratic process. Millions of eligible voters skip elections not out of apathy, but confusion — unclear registration rules, unknown polling locations, and intimidating ballot language. CivicIQ solves this with an AI-powered civic education platform that meets voters where they are: on their phones, in plain language, in real time.

The platform covers the full electoral lifecycle:
- Voter registration and eligibility
- Understanding ballot measures and propositions
- State-specific voting rules and deadlines
- Election Day logistics and voter rights
- Post-election certification and results process

---

## 2. Approach & Logic

### Design Philosophy
CivicIQ is built on three principles:
- **Nonpartisan** — Every AI response is governed by a strict system prompt that prohibits partisan opinions and encourages civic participation regardless of political affiliation
- **Accessible** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, with voice input, text-to-speech, dyslexia-friendly fonts, high contrast mode, and full keyboard navigation
- **Simple to deploy** — Single API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`), zero database dependencies, browser-based persistence

### AI Strategy
All intelligence is powered by **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** — a single unified model handles:
- Conversational civic Q&A with streaming
- Real-time election news via Search Grounding
- Multi-language translation (8 languages)
- Ballot measure plain-English explanation
- State-specific voting rule generation
- Quiz answer explanations
- Personalized voter guide PDF generation
- Civic rights summaries by voter profile

This unified approach means one API key, one billing account, one model to trust — and consistent nonpartisan tone across every feature.

### Decision Tree Logic
The **Civic Rights Navigator** uses a client-side decision tree with 6 voter profiles (First-time voter, Moved recently, Student, Non-English speaker, Disability, Returning citizen). Each profile maps to a tailored Gemini prompt that generates a personalized rights summary — making complex legal information feel like a conversation, not a document.

### Gamification Logic
The **Civic Passport** tracks feature engagement via `localStorage` boolean flags. Badges unlock when users: complete the quiz, use voice chat, finish the checklist, use the ballot explainer, bust 5 myths, and navigate the rights tree. This drives exploration of every feature — which directly improves the user's civic knowledge.

## 3. How the Solution Works

### Data Flow
```
User Input (Browser)
     ↓
Next.js Frontend (React Components)
     ↓
Next.js API Routes (Edge Runtime) ← GEMINI_API_KEY lives here only
     ↓
Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API
     ↓
Streamed / JSON Response
     ↓
React UI renders result
```

### Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Edge Runtime on all API routes** | Faster cold starts, lower global latency |
| **Streaming chat responses** | Real-time feel, no waiting for full response |
| **localStorage for persistence** | Zero backend infrastructure, instant reads |
| **sessionStorage for state cache** | State voting rules cached after first Gemini call |
| **In-memory rate limiting** | No Redis/Upstash needed, 20 req/IP/min enforced |
| **Browser TTS + STT** | Voice features with zero API cost |
| **SVG US map (inline)** | No Maps API needed for state explorer, fully accessible |
| **jsPDF for voter guide** | Client-side PDF generation, no server storage |

### API Routes

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/chat` | POST | Streaming civic Q&A via Gemini |
| `/api/translate` | POST | Translate UI text to 8 languages |
| `/api/quiz-explain` | POST | AI explanation for quiz answers |
| `/api/ballot` | POST | Plain-English ballot measure breakdown |
| `/api/news` | GET | Live election news via Gemini Search Grounding |
| `/api/state-rules` | POST | State-specific voting rules as structured JSON |
| `/api/voter-guide` | POST | Personalized voter guide content for PDF |

## 7. Assumptions Made

- **US-focused:** Election data, state rules, and timelines are US-centric. International election systems are not covered in the structured features (though the AI chat can discuss them).
- **Gemini availability:** The app assumes `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid and has quota. All AI features degrade gracefully with user-friendly error messages if the API is unavailable.
- **Browser support:** Voice input (Web Speech API) requires Chrome or Edge. Firefox users see a graceful fallback message.
- **No user accounts:** All progress (checklist, badges, quiz scores) is stored in `localStorage`. Clearing browser data resets progress. This is intentional — no PII collected, no auth required.
- **Election dates:** Hardcoded next major US election dates (Nov 2025 state elections, Nov 2026 midterms). These would be updated via a config file in production.
- **Polling locator:** Accuracy of polling place results depends on Google Places data. Users are always advised to verify with their official state election website.
- **Rate limiting:** In-memory rate limiting (20 req/IP/min) resets on server restart. Production deployments should use Redis-backed limiting.
- **PDF generation:** Voter guide PDF is generated client-side using jsPDF. Complex layouts may vary slightly across browsers.
- **Nonpartisanship:** The AI is instructed to remain nonpartisan but Gemini's responses are probabilistic. The system prompt enforces civic framing but cannot guarantee perfect neutrality in every edge case.

GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_client_secret_here
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/calendar/callback

# Google Analytics 4
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Firebase Client SDK
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id_here

## 13. Code Quality & Mobile Optimization

- **API Type Definitions:** Created comprehensive type definitions in `types/api.ts` (ChatMessage, StateRules, LeaderboardEntry, etc.) to eradicate `any` types.
- **Centralized Constants:** Extracted all hardcoded strings and settings to `lib/constants.ts` (GEMINI_MODEL, badges, phases, myths, etc.).
- **Utility and Custom Hooks:** Implemented custom hooks for type-safe and responsive operations:
  - `useLocalStorage.ts` for SSR-safe client persistence.
  - `useDebounce.ts` for delaying state updates cleanly.
  - `useMediaQuery.ts` for desktop vs mobile detection.
  - `useGemini.ts` for unified endpoint execution.
- **Improved Components:** Added `<ErrorBoundary />` and `<Skeleton />` for superior async error/loading experiences.
- **Mobile Experience & Responsiveness:**
  - Prevented input auto-zoom on iOS by setting inputs to `16px`.
  - Upgraded **Navbar** with a seamless right-sliding mobile navigation drawer and interactive hamburger toggle.
  - Optimized **Chat Assistant** with a 100dvh flex view, sticky input bar with safe-bottom margins, and horizontally-scrollable quick starter chips.
  - Revamped **State Explorer** to swap interactive SVG maps for a responsive mobile dropdown.
  - Refactored badge, card, and timeline layouts to fully support small screens without horizontal overflows.
